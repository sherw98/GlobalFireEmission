# Global Fire Emission

This is a project completed by the end of the semester for Data Visualization class. The data comes from Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center by Columbia University: https://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/set/sdei-global-fire-emissions-indicators-country-level-1997-2015.

RShiny app was created to better visualize data. The major function includes viewing chropleths by any given year and fire type, viewing time series plot by either a country or by a fire type, summary statistics, etc.
